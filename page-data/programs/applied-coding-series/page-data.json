Join us for a fun workshop that will walk you through everything you need to get started with your own AI project in Google Cloud!</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Gone Phishing: Password Security and Phishing Emails</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tuesday July 12th, 7pm-9pm EST\r\n𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻\r\nThe rise of Internet and computing technology has undoubtedly made our lives easier, but has also created a need to secure the abundance of virtual spaces we use daily (have you noticed the increase in Instagram accounts being hacked?!). In this workshop you will dive into the world of cybersecurity in one of its most basic forms: passwords. You will learn how passwords work, how to make them strong, and how they are attacked. You’ll also get a brief overview of phishing and learn how NOT to get baited.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Creating Your Own Space on \"The Web\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tuesday August 23rd and Thursday August 25th 7pm-9pm EST\r\n𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻\r\nThe web is a lovely place, but it'd be lovelier if you had your own space on it. This course will teach you the fundamentals of how to create your own website. We'll start with using the developer tools to understand what \"the web\" really is; host your own website you can share with your friends and hide from your family; and finish by empowering each other to feel like we can't only participate in using the web, but we can actually build and create our own part of it.</p>\n<p>To understand how the virtual applied coding series work, we are also hosting a kick off event shared with all 3 sessions on Thursday July 7th 7-8pm EST.</p>\n<p>𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗽𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂'𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗻!</p>\n<p>Open to all HER CODE CAMP alumni or folks with beginner knowledge of Python.</p>\n<p>⚠️ Please note there is a limited capacity, and this does not guarantee your enrolment. ⚠️ We will send you a confirmation for each workshop you apply to.</p>\n<p>Applications close June 30th!</p>\n<p>Questions?
