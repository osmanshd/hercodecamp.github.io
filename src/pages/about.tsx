            HER CODE CAMP is a non-profit organization that aims to empower
            under-represented communities in technology. Since being founded in
            2018, we have been hosting a variety of programs targeted to high
            school students who identify as a woman and/or non-binary (including
            cis and trans women) in Canada.

            We understand how learning to code can be difficult, especially when
            there is no sense of belonging and a lack of representation in
            technology. Our goal is to create a safe, inclusive community that
            makes learning accessible. We teach our campers basic coding, enable
            them to build their first projects, and get them connected to the
            tech world.
