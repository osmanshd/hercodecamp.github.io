title:  "Black Lives Matter"
---
HER CODE CAMP aims to empower under-represented communities in technology to create effective and fair solutions for all. Yet, the under-representation of people of color, especially Black folks, in computer science continues. Our goal of a better tech world can NOT be achieved until equity prevails and until systematic racism is eradicated. We stand in active solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. We are taking the following actions to begin the process towards anti-racism:

- Educate ourselves through diversity training
- Celebrate Black folks in CS
- Commit to a diverse set of panelists, mentors, organizers, participants
- Teach about the potential biases in CS in our workshops (ex. AI & Ethics workshops)
- Collaborate with organizations supporting Black communities

We have a long way to go, and we as an organization are committed to making the changes necessary to continually do our part. We encourage any feedback to our actions, and are always open to hearing about other ways we can show up for the BLM movement. We are listening and learning.
